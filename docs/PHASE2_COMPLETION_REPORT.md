## 🚀 Integration Strategy

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Build the modules**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Update index.html**:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/dist/luckygas.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Start migrating app.js**:
   - Use migration guides for each module
   - Replace fetch calls with API client
   - Replace utilities with module imports
   - Convert inline components to reusable ones

### Migration Priority:
