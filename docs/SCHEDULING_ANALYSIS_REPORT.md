4. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Modular service design
   - Async/await pattern for performance

#### Limitations:
1. **No Direct API Exposure**:
   - Scheduling service not exposed via REST API
   - Manual schedule application required
   - Limited external system integration

2. **Static Time Slots**:
   - Fixed 2-hour windows
   - No dynamic slot adjustment
   - Limited flexibility for urgent deliveries

3. **Limited Real-time Capabilities**:
   - No real-time rescheduling
   - No dynamic route adjustment
   - No traffic consideration

4. **Incomplete Integration**:
   - No automatic delivery creation
   - Manual approval required
   - Limited feedback loop

## Identified Issues and Inefficiencies

### 1. API Layer Gaps
- **Issue**: No REST API endpoints for scheduling operations
- **Impact**: Cannot trigger scheduling from web UI or external systems
- **Current State**: Service exists but not exposed

### 2. Resource Utilization
- **Issue**: Simple utilization calculation (deliveries/capacity)
- **Impact**: May not optimize for actual time/distance constraints
- **Current State**: Basic percentage-based tracking

### 3. Time Window Rigidity
- **Issue**: Fixed 2-hour slots without flexibility
- **Impact**: Cannot accommodate customer preferences or urgent deliveries
- **Current State**: Hardcoded time windows

### 4. Forecasting Limitations
- **Issue**: Basic confidence threshold (0.5) for all predictions
- **Impact**: May miss or over-schedule deliveries
- **Current State**: One-size-fits-all threshold

### 5. Route Integration
- **Issue**: Sequential process (schedule then route)
- **Impact**: Suboptimal overall solution
- **Current State**: Two-phase optimization

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. API Development (High Priority)
```python
# Recommended API endpoints
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/generate    # Generate schedule
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/{id}        # Get schedule details
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/{id}/apply  # Apply schedule
PUT    /api/v1/scheduling/{id}        # Modify schedule
